# Gameplay Mechanics

## Board Setup
- The game board consists of a grid of hexagonal tiles.
- The size of the board can be customized (e.g., 8x8, 10x10, etc.).
- Each player starts with one piece placed on their side of the board.

## Pieces
- Each player starts with 1 piece on the board and 9 pieces in reserve.
- Players can have a maximum of 10 pieces in play at any time.
- Initially, all pieces have the same movement and attack capabilities.

## Turn Structure
1. Players alternate turns.
2. At the start of their turn, a player can add a new piece to the board (if they have fewer than 10 pieces in play).
3. The player can then move one piece.
4. After moving, the turn passes to the other player.

## Adding Pieces
- At the start of their turn, if a player has fewer than 10 pieces on the board, they can add a new piece.
- New pieces are placed on any empty hex on the player's starting side of the board.
- A player cannot have more than 10 pieces on the board at any time.

## Movement
- Pieces can move to any adjacent hex tile.
- Movement is limited to one hex per turn.
- Pieces cannot move through or occupy the same hex as other pieces.
- Pieces can move in any of the six directions around a hex.

## Objective
- The primary goal is to destroy all 10 of the opponent's pieces.
- Players must also maintain at least one piece on the board to stay in the game.

## Game End Conditions
1. A player wins if they destroy all 10 of the opponent's pieces.
2. A player loses immediately if they have no pieces left on the board.

## Combat
- When a piece moves to a hex occupied by an opponent's piece, combat occurs.
- The attacking piece destroys the defending piece, removing it from the board.
- The attacking piece occupies the hex where combat occurred.

## Additional Rules (for future implementation)
- Special abilities for different piece types.
- Terrain effects on certain hex tiles.
- Capture mechanics.
