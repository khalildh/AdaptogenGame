# Proof of Concept (PoC) Development Steps

1. Setup Basic Hexagonal Grid
   - Frontend (React.js + PIXI.js): 
     - Render a basic hexagonal grid using PIXI.js
     - Implement clickable hexes with visual changes on click
     - No advanced graphics or animations required

2. Minimal Backend Server
   - Node.js + Express.js:
     - Develop a simple server to initialize game sessions
     - Handle requests to start a game and receive tile coordinates

3. Real-time Updates
   - Socket.IO:
     - Implement client-to-server messaging for hex clicks
     - Broadcast updates to all connected clients
     - Ensure real-time grid state updates across sessions

4. Basic User Interface
   - React.js + Tailwind CSS:
     - Create a simple UI to display the game board
     - Update the UI based on real-time interactions
     - Use Tailwind CSS for responsive and neat styling

5. Ephemeral Game State Handling
   - No Database Integration Initially:
     - Store game state temporarily in server memory or JSON object
     - Reset state on server restart
     - Simplify deployment and reduce initial complexity

6. Security and Authentication
   - OAuth (Simplified):
     - Implement basic OAuth for user authentication
     - Use a simple strategy with minimal permissions
     - Differentiate users in the game

7. Deployment
   - Cloud Services:
     - Deploy PoC using basic setup on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
     - Consider Heroku or Vercel for simpler setup and deployment

8. Testing and Feedback
   - Focus on technical functionality:
     - Test real-time interaction and basic game features
     - Prioritize connectivity and real-time updates over gameplay depth

## Steps Forward

- **Focus on Core Functionality:** 
  - Ensure smooth and bug-free interaction with the hex grid in real-time

- **Prepare for Iteration:** 
  - Set up a simple feedback mechanism (e.g., form or direct email link)
  - Collect user thoughts on the PoC

This streamlined approach allows for quick building and deployment of a proof of concept using all chosen technologies, while focusing on essential gameplay aspects to validate the idea and test the technology stack.
