# 3. Real-time Updates

## Technologies:
- [x] Socket.IO (v4.4.0 or later)
- [x] Express.js (already set up in Step 2)
- [x] React.js (client-side, already set up in Step 1)

## Steps:

### Server-side Setup:
- [x] Install Socket.IO: `yarn add socket.io@4.4.0`
- [x] Integrate Socket.IO with the Express server in `server.js`
- [ ] Implement event handlers for:
  - [x] New connections
  - [x] Disconnections
  - [ ] Hex clicks (game moves)

### Client-side Setup:
- [ ] Install Socket.IO client: `npm install socket.io-client@4.4.0`
- [ ] Create a socket connection in the React app
- [ ] Implement event listeners for:
  - [ ] Connection status
  - [ ] Game state updates

### Implement Real-time Communication:
- [ ] Modify the server to emit updates on game state changes
- [ ] Update the client to send hex click events to the server
- [ ] Ensure the client updates its state based on received events

### Testing:
- [ ] Test real-time updates with multiple browser windows
- [ ] Verify that all connected clients receive updates
- [ ] Test reconnection scenarios

### Error Handling:
- [ ] Implement error handling for socket disconnections
- [ ] Add reconnection logic on the client side

## Notes:
- Ensure low latency for real-time updates
- Consider implementing a simple chat feature as a bonus
- Prepare for scaling: consider room-based communication for multiple game sessions
